\title{Simulates a transition with exponentially distributed sojourn time}
\usage{
gen_transition(from_state, Q, M_state, sojourn.shape)
}
\arguments{
\item{from_state}{the current state to transition out of}

\item{Q}{transition rate matrix obtained from \code{gen_Qmat()}}

\item{M_state}{number of CTMC states (currently only support 2 or 3 states)}

\item{sojourn.shape}{a numeric scalar > 0. This is the shape parameter for the gamma distribution. \cr
Set to 1 if exponential (i.e., CTMC) is desired.}
}
\value{
a list containing two elements
\enumerate{
\item \strong{t} a numeric scalar. The exponentially distributed sojourn time it took to transition out of \code{from_state}
\item \strong{to_state} a numeric scalar. This is the state which the random process transitioned to
\item if something went wrong then NA values are returned
}
}
\description{
Generates the process of state transitioning. This is done by following 2 steps: \cr
(1) generate the time at which transition actually occurs \cr
(2) generate which what state is transitioned to
